DPS supplier driver and management software

This project is to create an open source driver and software for DPS suppliers.

DPS suppliers are a set of DC-DC converter software controllable via serial or bluetooht through modbus protocol.

There is a Windows software controller and Android application but they are closed source so there is no way to use them on Linux neither improve them.
